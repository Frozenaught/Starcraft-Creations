## Overview
A prestigious company like Starcraft Creations needs a professional-looking website. 

The company designs both original and custom 3D printed items and they wanted a website that reflects the quality of their work. 

That is why I have created this site as clean as possible, but still emphasising the selling of the products the company has to offer.

## UX
### User stories

##### Professional Customer
+ As a manufacturer, I wanted to have an easy way of getting prototypes 3D printed so that I can get my products to market with as little issues as possible.

##### Starcraft Creations
+ As a 3d printing business, we wanted a website that portrays our professionalism. We also wanted the process to be as simple as possible.

These are my wireframes I created during the design process, they were great as a guide to get started. Here you can also find the original [Balsamiq Mockup](/wireframes/) file.
