## Overview
A prestigious company like Starcraft Creations needs a professional-looking website. 

The company designs both original and custom 3D printed items and they wanted a website that reflects the quality of their work. 

That is why I have created this site as clean as possible, but still emphasising the selling of the products the company has to offer.
