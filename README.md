## Overview
A prestigious company like Starcraft Creations needs a professional-looking website. 

The company designs both original and custom 3D printed items and they wanted a website that reflects the quality of their work. 

That is why I have created this site as clean as possible, but still emphasising the selling of the products the company has to offer.

## UX
### User stories
##### Standard Customer
+ As a customer, I wanted to be able to purchase 3d printed products effortlessly without all the clutter I experience on some other sites.

##### Professional Customer
+ As a manufacturer, I wanted to have an easy way of getting prototypes 3D printed so that I can get my products to market with as little issues as possible.

##### Starcraft Creations
+ As a 3d printing business, we wanted a website that portrays our professionalism. We also wanted the process to be as simple as possible.

## Features
<!-- Top -->
**Navigation Bar**
I have made it so that the navigation bar will stay on top, no matter where you scroll to on the page, this allows for easy navigation at any time. The navigation bar will also collapse to reduce the clutter on smaller screen sizes. I have centered the text when this menu is collapsed. I think this looks very neat. 

**About section**
When I created the 'About Us' section, I made use of Bootstrap's card component. This helped to structure the content neatly and in an organized way.I also decided to add some customer comments to this section, should give a feel for the type of company Starcraft Creations are.

<!-- Deployment -->
## Deployment
This site makes use of GitHub's technology for deployment. I have used GitHub pages to serve the site. The deplyed version can be found here: https://frozenaught.github.io/Starcraft-Creations/, this relies on the [`index.html`](\index.html) file to make it work. 

For development I created a repository https://github.com/Frozenaught/Starcraft-Creations. 
- Use `git clone https://github.com/Frozenaught/Starcraft-Creations` to pull a copy of the repo to your computer.
- I would always recomend doing a git pull before starting any work on the project, this just insures youa re working on the latest version.
- Make any changes you need and commit using the command ` git commit -m "your message` after staging the content with the command `git add "name of file"` of `git add .` for staging all files.
- You can push this to the remote using `git push`
- If there is anything you would not like to include in your commit i have made a [`.gitignore`](\.gitignore) file, simply add the path to the file or folder and is will nolonger show up if you run `git status`.
- I suggest regular commits as this will avoid big issues that are hard to reverse.
- You could also make use of a seperate branch if you decide you want to experiment with things or dont want to work directly on the master branch. to do this use the `git checkout -b "branch name"` command. 
- You could then switch back to the master branch using `git checkout master`
