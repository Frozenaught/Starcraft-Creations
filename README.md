## Overview

I created a website for an imaginary 3D printing company that I called Starcraft Creations, the back story for the company is as follows:

Starcraft Creations is a prestigious company with an impeccable track record. A company that holds its standards very high and takes care of their customers.

They produce both original and custom-designed 3D printed items and they wanted a website that reflects the quality of their work, something they could be proud of.

That is why I have created this site as clean and responsive as possible, the overall goal is for the company to sell its services to customers.

## UX

### User stories

##### Standard Customer

- As a customer, I wanted to be able to purchase 3d printed products effortlessly without all the clutter I experience on some other sites.

##### Professional Customer

- As a manufacturer, I wanted to have an easy way of getting prototypes 3D printed so that I can get my products to market with as little issues as possible.

##### Starcraft Creations

- As a 3d printing business, we wanted a website that portrays our professionalism. We also wanted the process to be as simple as possible.

### Wireframes

These are my wireframes I created during the design process, they were great as a guide to get started. Here you can also find the original [Balsamiq Mockup](/wireframes/) file.

## Features

<!-- Top -->
**Logo**

I have taken care to ensure that the logo is as responsive as possible, keeping the spacing and size looking neat in as many screen sizes as possible. 
I also made sure to use the orange in the logo throughout the website as this is the company's brand color.

**Navigation Bar**

The navigation bar on the website incorporates some icons to give the menus some visual cues. 
I have also made it so that the active menu item is underlined to help indicate where you are currently at on the page.

**Landing Page**

I have a clean image that immediately conveys what that the company does on the landing page. 
I also included some text to reiterate the service the company offers. From the landing page I also made it so that you can request a quote without having to navigate anywhere else.
  
**About section**

When I created the 'About Us' section, I made use of Bootstrap's card component. This helped to structure the content neatly and in an organized way. I tried to kep this as simple and informative as possible with some visual styling to that is as aesthetically pleasing as possible.

**Services Section**

I tried to make this part of the site as informative as possible to the services the company would offer also allowing for the user to be able to 
request a quote at any point on the page. 

**Testimonials**

I wanted to incorporate a testimonials section on the site so that first time customers could have an ide of the kind of service they could expect from a company like Starcraft Creations.

**Team**

The team section was a late addition to give the side a more personal feel. I created the elements in this section to be round as I did not want to site to be too 'square'.

**Contact**

The contact page offers a map to the company and a simple form to get In touch in case you have any queries, you will also find the company address here.

**Footer**

Finally the footer gives you a link to instantly create an email to the company as well as links to the various social media platforms. 

**modals**

There is a quote modal that is set for you to create a request for a quote, this have a modal linked that will display that your request is successful so that you are able to see that something has happened once you hit the submit button. 

###Features left to implement
It would be good to get some javascript running ont the site, that way i can add some more things like doing something with the data that the user enters into the forms. I would also add a privacy pollicy at that stage. 
Anouther thing i would like to implement Is possibly some animation to the site, for instance to the testimonials scrolling through them or something like that.

### Tools for the job

Below is a list of tools i used to create this website.

- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - This is the IDE I used to start building the website.
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) - A free image editor I used to create and edit come of the site content.
- [Balsamq](https://balsamiq.com/) - All my wireframes were created in the desktop version of Balsamiq.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Used this editor for building parts of the website.
- [Git Hub](https://github.com/) - Used this site to manage my projects storage as well as host the website.
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) Used to double check all my spelling and grammar.
- [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) - used this to check my HTML for errors and typos.
- [W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - used this to check my CSS for errors.
- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - I used this tool to make sure i did not miss any prefixing in my code.

<!-- testing -->

## Testing

I tested my code using [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) as a start to pick up any small errors in the code here i discovered that I had left out the alt test for some of my images as well as some stray div tags. 
Throughout the process i would regularly test with these two tools to try to catch things early.

I tested the following features on multiple PC browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and Mobile devices (IOS, Android) and this is what I found:

###Navigation Bar
It quickly became apparent that on the smaller devices i needed to collapse the menu and shit the logo up to abominate the smaller sizes. so i found i needed to implement media queries at this stage to have more control of this.
When the menu was expanded i also saw it looked odd on the smaller devices so I decided to center the menu in the end. i lso was using a css scroll function and i realised it was not compatible in most browsers so I opted a JS solution in the end.

###Landing Image
This gave me loads of trouble on the ios devices as it simply would not render the image on the physical device, 
after many hours of trial and error and finally finding a stack overflow thread i realised that this was because of the image 
being fixed so i fixed this with a media query (Thanks stack overflow!) 
[Thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36686654/fixed-background-images-disappear-on-iphone-ipad)

###Header text
Seeing this on a physical device was helpful and i realised it was way too big when the device was turned that meant more media query work.

###About us 
After seeing this on a small device i realised there was not enough definition to the headers in the cards so i added an interline and made the text uppercase.

###Services
This section was redone multiple times as i had run in to many little bugs when testing the buttons kept covering the text on the smaller screens. When the modal would pop up after clicking the button it would add a strange padding to the background.
I spent alot of time bug fixing and testing this on multiple screensize's as its the main reason for this type of site.

###Testimonials
I originally had the testimonials in a horizontal line, that seemed of unti i changed the screen sizes and they lookes aff due to the 
different length of text each one had. the solution in the end was to put them in a single versicle line. this made it look much better.

###User testing
I believe this was the most important tests of all, i had some friends and family test the site and the feedback was invaluable. I think when you have been staring at the same site for weeks its hard to see the little errors. they discovered Typos and grammar mistakes. 
One also suggested that I add the success modal to the submit button on the quote form as it felt like you were left hanging. hey spotted small spacing issues also. At that stage a few commented on the Logo being too pixelated on their devices so I remade the logo at a higher resolution.

<!-- Deployment -->

## Deployment

This site makes use of GitHub's technology for deployment. I have used GitHub pages to serve the site. The deplyed version can be found here: https://frozenaught.github.io/Starcraft-Creations/, this relies on the [`index.html`](\index.html) file to make it work.

For development I created a repository https://github.com/Frozenaught/Starcraft-Creations.

- Use `git clone https://github.com/Frozenaught/Starcraft-Creations` to pull a copy of the repo to your computer.
- I would always recommend doing a git pull before starting any work on the project, this just insures you are working on the latest version.
- Make any changes you need and commit using the command `git commit -m "your message` after staging the content with the command `git add "name of file"` of `git add .` for staging all files.
- You can push this to the remote using `git push`
- If there is anything you would not like to include in your commit i have made a [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) file, simply add the path to the file or folder and is will nolonger show up if you run `git status`.
- I suggest regular commits as this will avoid big issues that are hard to reverse.
- You could also make use of a separate branch if you decide you want to experiment with things or dont want to work directly on the master branch. to do this use the `git checkout -b "branch name"` command.
- You could then switch back to the master branch using `git checkout master`
